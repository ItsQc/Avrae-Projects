# Avrae-Projects

A place for me to share my remotely presentable aliases, snippets, and etc. for the Avrae discord bot.
I'm no Avrae or Python expert. Just because I have put it here does not neccessarily mean it is user-ready or user-friendly.
I can be slow to reply and make changes on github but I will eventually approve a good pull request if you make them.

If you know me on discord, you can ping or DM me about stuff in this repository.
