# Avrae-Projects

A place for me to share my aliases, snippets, and etc. for the Avrae discord bot.
I'm no Avrae or Python expert. Just because I have put it here does not neccessarily mean it is user-ready or user-friendly.
I don't check my github often but feel free to make pull requests or whatever.

If you know me on discord, you can ping or DM me about stuff in this repository.
