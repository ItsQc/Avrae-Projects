Casting works just the same as ``!cast``, including being able to take all the same arguments and displaying your spell slot counters. Works with the popular ``!prep`` alias by default. If you expended a spell slot, it includes a field to show your spell slot counters for that level.
This works regardless of using ``-noprep`` when importing or updating your sheet.
For for further information see ``!help cast`` and ``!help prep``.

Commands:
- ``list`` Adjust settings for where ``!pcast`` checks for your spell preparations. It is unlikely you need to use this command.
