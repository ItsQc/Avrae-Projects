xm is short for x-multi, it is like an expansion to the multiline command.

It is middle-ground tool for turning a blurbs of commands that can be run with multiline, 
but you don't want to make a fullblown alias/custom action. Basically quick and dirty alias for multilines.

This tool is still in development.

In terms of commands, x-multiline faces the same limitations in which ones it can use, as such it cannot call other aliases.
