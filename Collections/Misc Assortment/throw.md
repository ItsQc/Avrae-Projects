Create a counter to thrack your thrown weapon. If your attack/action isn't named the same as a standard phb thrown weapon, it will create one for you. You can type the name after the snippet if you want to specify. Accepts partial matches of at least 3 letters of phb thrown weapons or an existing thrown weapon counter. Automatically negates the rage bonus damage for melee attacks if you're raging. Will not reduce rage damage if `!cvar throwAlwaysNoRage 1` is set, for users who don't auto-add rage damage when raging.

Examples ``!a shuriken throw dag``   ``!a javelin throw``
